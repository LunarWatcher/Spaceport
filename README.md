# Spaceport

Modular and extensible dashboard for LAN use, service monitoring, etc., designed with cross-device scripting in mind.

Not remotely recommended for public-facing dashboards unless you're willing to take unchecked and untested risks.

Also supports some limited automation as defined by clients.
