# Running tests

**Note:** I do not recommend manually running tests. They require access to a database, and will eat anything that conflicts with test dependencies or tables. It needs a user called `spaceport-test` that can log in without a password, into a database by the same name.

Postgresql is extremely unfriendly from a consumer test POV, by not offering an (easily discoverable) way to automate testing.

Tests are generated into build/bin/tests. The tests themselves are automated even though the database setup is not. I strongly recommend looking at the GitHub Action to see the general exact command flow, as this won't be documented here.

As an aside, if you know of a better way to automate this testing, consider creating a pull request. I have 0 experience with postgresql or other large-scale databases (except mongodb, but even that automation was a pain in the ass, and it was brief at best), and the whole lot appear to be equally unfriendly for this type of use.
